I'm a **PhD fellow in fundamental research** of the [Research Foundation-Flanders (FWO)](https://www.fwo.be/en/), performing analyses of astrophysical observations in the research groups of [Prof. Dr. Hans Van Winckel](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=XF-c7_IAAAAJ&hl=nl) at [KU Leuven's Institute of Astronomy (IoA)](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster) and [Prof. Devika Kamath](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=RXjUr1IAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Macquarie University's Astrophysics and Space Technologies Research Centre (ASTRC)](https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/centres/astrophysics-and-space-technologies).

Our research focuses on observations of a specific type of **evolved low-to-intermediate mass stars**, called post-AGB stars. Stripped of their exterior in the preceding evolutionary phase, these stars now rapidly contract and approach the final stages of their life. If orbited by an unevolved companion star, we call these stellar systems post-AGB binaries. In many binaries, the ejected star material has been shepherded into gigantic **circumbinary discs** of dust and gas, similar to the planet-forming environment around the youngest stars. Aside from **tracing previous stages of stellar evolution**, especially binary post-AGBs show a variety of **ongoing inter-component interactions**, including **disc-binary interactions**, **jet formation** and possible **planet-disc interactions**.

We observe these system in order to constrain the crucial, but poorly understood binary star interactions and creation of heavy elements that took place when the evolved star was a swolen giant, and the effect the ongoing interactions might have on the final fate of these stars. This extensive scientific scope requires us to deploy a wide range of techniques, the following of which I am personally familiar with:

- **Long baseline optical interferometry** to image the inner regions of the circumbinary discs at unrivaled resolution, constraining their structure, morphology, interactions with the central stars and the possibility embedded giant planets. These observations are interpreted using a host of tools, including in-group-developed software packages to perform intricate [neural network image reconstruction](https://github.com/DePrinsT/organic) and [fitting of radiative transfer models](https://github.com/DePrinsT/distroi).

- **High resolution spectral time-series** to both derive the orbits of the binary stars and facilitate the detection of fast and collimated jet-like outflows, simultaneously constraining the theory of binary star evolution and interaction, as well as the theory of **magnetohydrodynamic jet formation** with one homogeneous dataset.

- **Optical/infrared spectroscopic abundance analysis** to determine the composition of post-AGB star atmospheres, constraining the **creation of elements** and molecules, as well as re-accretion of dust-depleted gas from the discs surrounding post-AGB binaries.

My research interests span from data analysis on unique datasets to the development of image reconstruction and model fitting software tools to extract as much physically meaningful information as possible from these costly observations. Currently, I focus on long baseline interferometry of post-AGB circumbinary discs, specifically the reconstruction of images and fitting of radiative transfer models, in order to constrain their structure, morphology, and inter-component interactions.
